# DFICyclingInstructionsandChecklist

This is an app designed to perform basic checklist functions and store the values in a txt file on the phone. It additionally has built in videos
to provide a visual guide for the users to follow. It has functions that pull the location of the device as well as the current weather via a JSON
request. The main function is the time synchronisation data it saves to time sync all of the data during the data processing phase.
